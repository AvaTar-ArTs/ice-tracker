## What Git AI Is

- **Open-source Git extension** that tracks which lines of code were **generated by AI** and links them to the **prompt** and **agent/model** that produced them.
- **Tagline:** “Track AI code all the way to production.”
- **Vendor-agnostic:** Works with Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Continue, Droid, Factory AI, Junie, RovoDev, etc.
- **Git-native:** Stores attributions in **Git notes** (`refs/notes/ai`); survives rebase, merge, squash, cherry-pick. No background daemons or file watchers; **agents explicitly mark** AI-generated lines (no heuristics).
- **Install once per machine** (not per repo). Optional **VS Code / Cursor extension** for gutter blame and prompt hover.

---

## How It Works (Short)

1. **Coding agents** that support the standard call the Git AI CLI to mark inserted lines as AI-generated (pre- and post-edit **checkpoints**).
2. **Checkpoints** are stored in `.git/ai` until commit; then Git AI condenses them into an **Authorship Log** and attaches it to the commit via a **git note**.
3. **On push/fetch**, notes are synced so all contributors have authorship data.
4. **`git-ai blame <file>`** overlays AI attribution on normal `git blame` (which commit last changed each line), so you see human vs AI (and which tool/model/prompt) per line.

Design choices:

- No single-vendor lock-in; multi-agent by design.
- Track code that **lands** (not fuzzy “generated vs accepted” only).
- No file watchers, keyloggers, or long-running daemons.
- No guessing: agents **tell** Git AI which hunks are AI-generated.

## Install

**Mac / Linux / WSL:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://usegitai.com/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (non-WSL):**

```powershell
irm https://usegitai.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer:

- Downloads the binary for your platform.
- Creates symlinks so `git` invocations go through Git AI (e.g. `~/.git-ai/bin/git`).
- Installs hooks for your IDE/agent (e.g. Cursor’s `beforeSubmitPrompt` and `afterFileEdit`).

No per-repo setup; use `git` and commit as usual.

---

## Cursor Integration

- **Supported since:** 2025-10-15.
- **Agent mode:** ✓  
- **Tab completion:** ✓ (beta)  
- **Cursor CLI:** ✗ (waiting for pre-edit hook)  
- **Prompt saving:** ✓  

Git AI uses Cursor’s **Hooks** (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`): `beforeSubmitPrompt` and `afterFileEdit` run `git-ai checkpoint cursor --hook-input stdin` so each agent edit is recorded. Install adds these automatically; re-run `git-ai install-hooks` if needed.

**Check that it’s working:** After some AI edits, run `git-ai status` — you should see checkpoints (you vs AI %, recent edits with tool/model). If not, verify `which git` points to `~/.git-ai/bin/git` and that the Hooks output channel in Cursor shows no errors.

## Main Commands / Features

| Command / feature | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------|
| **`git-ai status`** | Show current working tree: % you vs AI, recent checkpoints (tool, model, +/- lines). |
| **`git-ai blame <file>`** | Like `git blame` but with AI attribution per line (tool, model, and optionally prompt). |
| **`git-ai blame <file> --json`** | Raw blame data as JSON for IDEs or code-review tools. |
| **Prompt storage** | Prompts (and optionally plans) saved and linked to the code they generated; view in extension hover or via CLI. |
| **Prompt analysis** | Analyze acceptance rates, durability, categories (e.g. Bug vs Feature); personal dashboard at usegitai.com/me. |
| **Personal stats** | Track AI adoption over time, “generated vs shipped” LoC, plan mode vs no plan, etc. |

After every **`git commit`**, Git AI prints a short summary (e.g. “you / ai” %, “80% AI code accepted”).

---

## IDE Extension (VS Code / Cursor)

- **Gutter decorations** show which lines are AI-authored (and optionally same-prompt lines); color by prompt.
- **Hover** can show the prompt that generated the code (if prompt storage is enabled).
- **Blame modes:** Off / Line (current line + same prompt) / All (all AI lines).
- **Install:** Often installed with the CLI; otherwise: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=git-ai.git-ai-vscode), [Open VSX for Cursor](https://open-vsx.org/extension/git-ai/git-ai-vscode).

---

## Open Standard

- Format and behavior are specified in the **Git AI Standard** (e.g. v3.0.0): [github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai) (specs in repo).
- Authorship is stored in **Git notes** so it’s part of the repo and can be pushed/pulled; hosting support varies (GitHub: notes push but no web UI; GitLab: native notes support).

---

## History Rewriting

Git AI rewrites authorship logs when history is rewritten so attribution stays correct after:

- merge, rebase, cherry-pick, amend, `reset --soft`/`--mixed`, stash/pop, worktrees, etc.

**Known limitation:** `git mv` does not move attribution to the new path yet. Some reformatting edge cases can shift line counts slightly.

**Web UI squash/rebase:** GitHub/GitLab squash or rebase in the UI don’t run Git AI locally; they offer (or plan) **CI / webhook** solutions to reconstruct notes for the new commit.

## Uninstall

```bash
git-ai uninstall-hooks
rm -rf ~/.git-ai
# Optionally remove the PATH entry for ~/.git-ai/bin from shell config
```

## Summary Table

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Git extension for line-level AI authorship (tool, model, prompt) in Git notes. |
| **How** | Agents call `git-ai checkpoint`; on commit, notes store authorship; `git-ai blame` overlays it. |
| **Where** | usegitai.com (product + docs), github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai (OSS + standard). |
| **Install** | One-liner per OS; no per-repo setup. |
| **Cursor** | Hooks in `~/.cursor/hooks.json`; Agent + Tab completion supported; use `git-ai status` to verify. |
