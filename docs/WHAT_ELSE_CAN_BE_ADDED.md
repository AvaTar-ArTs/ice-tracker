# What else can be added (pointer)

The full **What else can be added** doc lives in the git-ai install (machine-wide), not in this repo:

**`~/.git-ai/docs/WHAT_ELSE_CAN_BE_ADDED.md`**

Open that file locally for the full research. It covers: §1 Git AI, §2 CI, §3 Ice-tracker app, §4 Repo/docs, §5 ~/.git-ai, §6 Fancier with ~/.env.d APIs, §7 Beyond git, §8 Quick reference. Sections 2–4 and 7.1 use ice-tracker as the example; the rest is generic.
