how do i find Information Required for Automation

    1. Hostinger FTP Credentials
     - FTP Hostname/Server
     - FTP Username
     - FTP Password
     - Port (usually 21 for FTP, 22 for SFTP)

    2. Database Information
     - Database Host (usually localhost or provided by Hostinger)
     - Database Name
     - Database Username
     - Database Password
     - Database Type (MySQL or PostgreSQL)

    3. Domain Information
     - Main domain: avatararts.org
     - Subdomain to use: ice-tracker.avatararts.org (or another subdomain of
       your choice)

    4. Backend Server Information
    Since the application requires Node.js, PostgreSQL, and background
    processing, we'll need a separate server for the backend. Do you have:
     - A VPS or cloud server (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, etc.)?
     - Or should I provide instructions for setting one up?

    5. Environment Variables
     - Mapbox token for maps (free at mapbox.com)
     - Any other API keys you want to use

Hi Steven — here’s where to pull each item in hPanel for **avatararts.org**.

## 1) FTP credentials (Host, user, port, password)
- Go to **Websites → avatararts.org → Dashboard → FTP Accounts**: [https://hpanel.hostinger.com/websites](https://hpanel.hostinger.com/websites)
- There you’ll see:
  - **FTP Hostname/Server**: use your **Hosting IP** (or the hostname shown there)
  - **FTP Username**: shown in that page (unique per website)
  - **Port**: **21** for FTP (use **22** only if you’re connecting via SFTP/SSH)
- **FTP Password** is *not displayed* for security. On the same page click **Change FTP password** to set a new one (store it securely).
- Your site’s web root (upload path) is: `/home/u365102102/domains/avatararts.org/public_html`

## 2) Database information (host/name/user/password/type)
- Go to **Websites → avatararts.org → Dashboard → Databases → MySQL Databases** (or **PostgreSQL** if you created one).
- You’ll get:
  - **Database host** (often `localhost` on shared hosting—use whatever hPanel shows)
  - **Database name / username**
  - **Password**: you can **change/reset** it there if you don’t know it
  - **Database type**: on shared hosting it’s typically **MySQL**; **PostgreSQL** is only if you’ve created a PostgreSQL DB (usually on VPS)

## 3) Domain + subdomain
- Main domain: **avatararts.org**
- To create the subdomain: **Websites → avatararts.org → Subdomains → Create** and add `ice-tracker` (this makes `ice-tracker.avatararts.org`).

## 4) Backend server (Node.js + PostgreSQL + workers)
On **Premium Web Hosting (shared hosting)**, you generally can’t run a persistent Node.js backend + background workers reliably—this is best on a **VPS**.  
Tell me if you already have a VPS; if not, I can outline the quickest Hostinger VPS setup checklist (Node, PostgreSQL, reverse proxy, SSL).

## 5) Environment variables
- **Mapbox token**: from your Mapbox account dashboard (you paste it into your app’s `.env` / server config).
- Other API keys: same idea—collect them from each provider, then add as env vars on your backend server (or in your deployment pipeline).

If you tell me whether you want the backend to run on a **Hostinger VPS** and which DB you want (**PostgreSQL** vs **MySQL**), I’ll give you the exact “copy/paste” list of values your automation needs.

which of my many websites would be best to host this project
(12/02/2026 06:22)

[Kodee]
All of your active sites (**gptjunkie.com, avatararts.org, aiworkflowalchemy.com, quantumforgelabs.org, automaitionapi.org**) are on the **same Premium Web Hosting plan** (shared hosting), so *performance/limits will be essentially the same* no matter which domain you pick.

For this project specifically:
- **Best choice for the public site/UI:** **avatararts.org** (it matches the project/brand and you can cleanly use `ice-tracker.avatararts.org` as the app subdomain).
- **Best choice for the backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL + background workers):** **none of these shared-hosting websites**—you’ll want a **VPS** for the backend, then point a subdomain like `api.avatararts.org` (or `ice-tracker.avatararts.org`) to that VPS.

If you tell me whether you want `ice-tracker.avatararts.org` to be **frontend**, **backend**, or **both**, I’ll recommend the exact subdomain split and DNS setup.

what is a vps backend and can i use it? meaning is it already enabled or do i need to purchase? if so no

### What a “VPS backend” means
A **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** is your own small server with dedicated resources and full control (you can run long‑running apps like a **Node.js API**, **PostgreSQL**, and **background workers/cron jobs** reliably). Shared hosting is mainly for PHP websites and isn’t ideal for always-on Node + workers.

### Can you use it / is it already enabled?
On your account right now, I only see **Premium Web Hosting (shared hosting)** and **no active VPS**, so it’s **not enabled**—you’d need to **purchase a VPS** to use one.

### If you don’t want to purchase
You can still host the project on your current hosting, but you’ll need to adjust the architecture (e.g., **WordPress/PHP-based** or a mostly **static frontend** that talks to third‑party services, and avoid a persistent Node+Postgres+workers stack).

Tell me which parts you *must* have (Node API? PostgreSQL? background jobs?), and I’ll suggest the best “no-VPS” setup.
