    <p class="page-subtitle">Essential information about your constitutional rights during encounters with immigration enforcement. This is general information, not legal advice.</p>

    <div class="rights-section">
      <h3>Your Rights if ICE Comes to Your Door</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You do <strong>not</strong> have to open the door. ICE cannot enter without a <strong>judicial warrant</strong> signed by a judge (not an ICE administrative warrant).</li>
        <li>Ask the agent to slide any warrant under the door. A valid judicial warrant will be signed by a judge and list your specific address.</li>
        <li>An ICE administrative warrant (Form I-200 or I-205) does <strong>not</strong> give agents the right to enter your home.</li>
        <li>You can say: "I do not consent to entry. Please slide any warrant under the door."</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rights-section">
      <h3>Your Rights if Stopped in Public</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>You can say: "I am exercising my right to remain silent."</li>
        <li>Do not sign anything you do not understand.</li>
        <li>Do not provide false documents. It is better to remain silent than to present false information.</li>
        <li>You have the right to speak to a lawyer before signing anything or answering questions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rights-section">
      <h3>Your Rights if Detained</h3>

      <h3>At a Checkpoint or Traffic Stop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>At border checkpoints (within 100 miles of any border), agents can ask about citizenship. You may choose to remain silent but this may prolong the stop.</li>
        <li>Agents cannot search your vehicle without <strong>consent, a warrant, or probable cause</strong>.</li>
        <li>You can say: "I do not consent to a search."</li>

        <li>You have the right to remain silent and do not have to answer questions about your status.</li>
        <li>You can ask: "Am I free to leave?" If yes, you may calmly walk away.</li>
